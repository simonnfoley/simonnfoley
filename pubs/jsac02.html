<font size=-1>S.N. Foley. A Non-Functional Approach to System Integrity.
IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Commications, To appear, 2003.</font>
<br><b><font size=-1></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font size=-1></font></b>
<p><font size=-1><b>Abstract </b>Systems provide integrity protection by
ensuring that there is no unauthorized modification of information. Traditional
models of protection tend to define integrity in terms of ad-hoc authorization
techniques whose effectiveness is justified more on the basis of experience
and ``best practice'', rather than on any common theoretical foundation.
A formal definition of integrity is proposed that is independent of any
particular implementation mechanism. A series of simple examples are used
to demonstrate that existing integrity mechanisms such as separation of
duties, well-formed transactions,&nbsp; and so forth, can be regarded as
implementation techniques for achieving integrity. The proposed characterization
of integrity is non-functional, that is, it falls into the same category
of&nbsp; properties as non-interference and its relatives. As a consequence,
validating that a system has integrity can be expected to be as challenging
as validating that a system upholds non-interference.</font>
