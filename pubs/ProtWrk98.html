<b> Abstract </b>
The notion of external consistency---that system state correctly
reflects the real world---provides a basis for a denotational
definition of integrity. We regard segregation of duties, well formed
transactions, auditing, replication, MACs, and so forth, as simply
implementation techniques: they define {\it how\/} to achieve this
notion of integrity in an operational sense.  Therefore, we argue that
when a designer claims that a system is fault-tolerant, or that a
protocol properly authenticates, or that a system is secure against
fraud, then what the designer is actually claiming is that it is
externally consistent.  An advantage of taking this view is that it
allows us to give a meaning to the `security' of a system that 
uses a combination of these implementation techniques.
