<b> Abstract </b>


CSCW systems provide computer support to facilitate cooperation
between users. 
 In this paper we propose an approach for the formal
specification of functionality requirements and confidentiality security
requirements of a CSCW application. 
 These requirements give rise to various
safety and confidentiality properties that a CSCW system, supporting
the application, should uphold.  
The specification technique is illustrated with a case study.
