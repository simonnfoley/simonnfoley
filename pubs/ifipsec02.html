<b> Abstract </b>
<p>
WebCom  is a
distributed computing architecture
 that may be used  to distribute 
application components
for execution over a network. 
A practical trust management system for the WebCom 
architecture is described. 
KeyNote-based authorization credentials are used to determine whether 
a WebCom server is authorised to schedule, and whether
a WebCom client is authorised to execute, mobile application
components.  Secure WebCom provides a  meta-language
for bringing together the  components of a distributed 
application in such a way that the components
need not concern themselves with security issues.
