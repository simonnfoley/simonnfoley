<b> Abstract </b>

Reflexive flow policies provide abstract characterizations of
certain multilevel confidentiality requirements. 
This paper describes how reflexive flow policies can be used to 
construct and reason about large/complex multilevel policies. 
In particular, we describe how reflexive policies can be used to
develop and reason about security policies for multilevel relational
databases. Our approach facilitates a study of the relationship between
security policy design and database design.
