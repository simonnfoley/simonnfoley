A Security Model of Dynamic Labeling Providing a
 Tiered Approach to Verification

<b> Abstract </b>



In the proposed mandatory access control model,  
arbitrary label changing policies can be expressed.
The relatively simple model 
can capture a wide variety of security policies, including
high-water marks, downgrading, separation of duties, and
Chinese Walls. 
The model forms the basis for a tiered approach to the formal 
development of secure systems, whereby security verification can
be spread across what makes up the reference monitor and the 
security requirement  specification. 
The advantage of this approach is that once a trusted computing base 
(TCB) is in place, reconfiguring it for different security requirements 
requires verification of just the new requirements. 
We illustrate the approach with a number of examples, including
one policy that permits high-level subjects to make relabeling requests 
on low-level objects;  the policy is multilevel secure.
