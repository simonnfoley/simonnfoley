<b> Abstract </b>

Conventional models of system integrity tend to be
implementation-oriented in that they define integrity in terms of
specific controls such as separation of duties, well-formed
transactions, and so forth.  In this paper we propose a formal
definition of integrity that is based on the notion of dependability
and is implementation independent.  Using a series of examples, we
argue that separation of duties, assured pipelines, fault-tolerance,
and cryptography may be viewed as implementation techniques for
achieving integrity.
