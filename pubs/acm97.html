<b> Abstract </b>

A framework for the specification of security policies is proposed.  It
can used to formally specify confidentiality and integrity
policies,  the latter can be given in terms of Clark-Wilson
style access triples.  The framework extends the Clark-Wilson model in
that it can be used to specify dynamic segregation of duty.
 
For application systems where security is critical, a multilevel
security based approach is defined.  Security policies for less
critical applications can be implemented using standard Unix based
systems. Both implementation strategies are based on the standard
protection mechanisms that are provided by the respective systems.
