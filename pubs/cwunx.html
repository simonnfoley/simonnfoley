<b> Abstract </b>

The set-user-id facility in Unix can be used to form the basis for the
implementation of a wide variety of different security policies in
Unix.  We show how the Chinese Wall security policy can be implemented
using this facility.  The approach is not appropriate for security
critical applications: it serves to illustrate that it can be done in a
rather simple way, and may be useful for less critical applications.
Our technique also provides an approach to implementing dynamic
segregation of duties in Unix.
