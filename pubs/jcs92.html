    <h1>Aggregation and Separation as Noninterference Properties</h1>

This paper proposes a notation that can be used to describe
information flow  policies that may have transitivity, aggregation and
separation (of duty) exceptions. Operators for comparing, composing
and abstracting these policies are described. These allow complex
policies to be
built from simpler policies. A formal semantics is given
based on the notion of noninterference for deterministic systems. 
An unwinding of this definition is developed that can be used for 
any policy that does not contain a separation exception.
