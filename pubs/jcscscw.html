<b> Abstract </b>

 CSCW systems provide computer support to facilitate cooperation
  between users.  This paper proposes an approach to the formal 
  specification of security requirements for CSCW applications, where a
  CSCW application is viewed as a collection of activities that users
 may participate in.  The specification approach is straightforward,
  and can be used to capture a wide variety of security requirements,
  including integrity and confidentiality. It is illustrated with a
  case study of a secure electronic examinations system.
