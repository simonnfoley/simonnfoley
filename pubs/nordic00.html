Exploiting KeyNote in WebCom: Architecture Neutral Glue
for Trust Management.

<b> Abstract </b>
A practical trust management system for the WebCom 
distributed computing architecture is described. 
KeyNote credentials are 
used to determine the authorisation of X509 authenticated 
SSL connections between peers.
WebCom provides a  meta-language (glue) 
for bringing together the  components of a distributed 
application in such a way that the components
need not concern themselves with synchronisation 
or concurrency issues. 
The integration of KeyNote in WebCom enhances the 
trust management framework by providing for a 
complete separation of security from  the 
components of a distributed application
into a single security critical component. 
This encourages a loose coupling between application
components and trust management, which, in addition 
to supporting off the shelf application components, 
results in applications that are easier to develop, 
understand, maintain and secure.
