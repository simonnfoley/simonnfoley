<b> Abstract </b>

We investigate how protection requirements may be specified 
and implemented using the imperative, availability and coercion
paradigms.  Conventional protection mechanisms generally 
follow the imperative paradigm, requiring explicit and often
centralized control over the sequencing and the 
mediation of security critical operations. 
This paper illustrates how casting protection in the 
availability and/or coercion styles
 provides the basis for more flexible and potentially
distributed control over the sequencing 
and mediation of these operations.
