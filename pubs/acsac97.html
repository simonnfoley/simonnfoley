<b> Abstract </b>

Secure canonical upgrade policies are multilevel relabel  policies
that, under certain conditions, allow high-level subjects to update
low-level security labels.  This paper describes a scheme whereby these
policies can be supported within the Message Filter Model for
multilevel secure object-oriented database management systems.
