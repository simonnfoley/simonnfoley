<b> Abstract </b>

Mandatory label-based policies may be used to support a wide-range of
application security requirements.  Labels encode the security state of
system entities and the security policy specifies how these labels may
change.  Building on previous results, this paper develops a 
model for a kernelized framework for supporting these policies.  
The framework provides the
basis for, what is essentially,  an interpreter of multilevel programs:
programs that manipulate multilevel label data-structures.  This
enables application functionality and security concerns to be developed
separately, bringing with it the advantages of a separation of concerns
paradigm.
