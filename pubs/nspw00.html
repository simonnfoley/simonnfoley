<b> Abstract </b>

Synchronizing Personal Digital Assistants 
with host systems can result in 
indirect accesses that bypass security requirements.
In this paper we propose a framework for 
analyzing  the security vulnerabilities 
that can arise from synchronization.
This framework provides us with the basis of 
a paradigm for analyzing the access-control  
vulnerabilities of systems  comprised of secure and 
non-secure  components.
